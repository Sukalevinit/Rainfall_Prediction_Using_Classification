Rainfall Prediction Using Classification
This project uses machine learning classification techniques to predict rainfall based on historical weather data.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature selection

Model training using classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest)

Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

Requirements
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn

How to Run
Clone this repository

Open Rainfall_Prediction_Using_Classification.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

Run all cells sequentially

Output
The notebook will display model accuracy, confusion matrix, and other evaluation metrics for rainfall prediction.
